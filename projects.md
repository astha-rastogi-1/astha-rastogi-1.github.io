    </li>
    <li>Utilized Interactive Machine Learning and Machine
        Reading Comprehension techniques to develop an
        innovative model at the University of Manchester.
    </li>
    <li>Created a system that extracts events from unstructured
        online data using a semi-supervised approach, generating
        machine-readable event templates without pre-existing
        annotations.
    </li>
    <li>Trained the model to ask relevant questions, improving
        its accuracy in structuring event information.
    </li>
    <li>Inculcated strong research, problem-solving, and critical
        thinking skills through collaborative work with academic
        mentors and experts, enhancing communication,
        teamwork, and model design abilities.

      <p class="subheading-split-left-first">Book Recommendation System</p>
    </div>
  </div>
  <ul class="content-list">
    <li>Created a model that takes a book title as input, calculates similarity scores between that book and all other books, and returns the top 20 most similar book titles and authors.
    </li>
    <li>Performed TF-IDF(Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization using a custom analyzer with word and bi-gram (1-2 word) features, ignoring stopwords, and considering all words.
    </li>
    <li>Calculated cosine similarity between the TF-IDF vectors, creating a similarity matrix.
