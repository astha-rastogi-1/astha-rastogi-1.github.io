        My journey has been a blend of innovation and learning, where I've honed my expertise in full stack and front-end development. In the dynamic world of startups, I've had the privilege of wearing multiple hats—implementing robust backends, crafting seamless frontends, optimizing databases, and seamlessly integrating and crafting machine learning models to birth industry-ready products.
